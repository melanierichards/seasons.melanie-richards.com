With the many distractions life has to offer, it is all too easy to let the seasons slip by and wonder where an entire year has gone. This site is an effort to observe the seasons with intentionality. Each season documents ways to observe the moment, pulling often from pagan traditions. The temporal ideas—particularly lists of events—are tailored towards the Seattle area, where [yours truly](https://melanie-richards.com) lives. Many of them may be applicable elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest or indeed, elsewhere in the Northern hemisphere.

“Don’t you think maybe they are the same thing, love and attention?” —Sister Sarah Joan, from the film _Ladybird_. May you appreciate the season you’re in.
