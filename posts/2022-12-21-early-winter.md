Winter is a period of dormancy, a time to restore your energy after a full and busy year. Take this opportunity to slow down, relax a little, and take comfort.

## Yule

Yule is a celebration of the winter solstice, or the longest night of the year. Yule marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of dark winter months. Focus on bringing light into the world, whether that's gift giving, volunteering, lighting candles, or enjoying a fire. Symbols: cookies, dried fruit and nuts, eggnog, cider and wassail; evergreen, frankincense, holly, laurel, pine, sage, green, red, gold.

* Light candles (someday: a log for a fireplace?)
