Fall is the harvest season, a time to take stock of goals and how much progress you were able to make. Celebrate the successes and mull over how to make more progress next time. Consider what’s not working and clear it away.

## Samhain

Samhain marks the end of the harvest season and the beginning of longer, darker months. Traditions held that the veil between the living and the dead was thinnest at this time. Samhain is a good time to set new intentions and goals, and to celebrate loved ones who have passed on. Symbols: pumpkins, apples, pears, root vegetables; bat, cat, cauldron, calendula, acorns, gourds.
