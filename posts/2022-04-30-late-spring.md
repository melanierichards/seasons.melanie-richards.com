Spring is a time for rebirth; for starting new projects; for revisiting goals and setting new ones. Put energy into setting intentions for the year ahead.

## Beltane

Pagan traditions observe Beltane as a celebration of fertility. This is a great time to take action on projects, creative and otherwise. Symbols: dairy, honey, and oats; flowers, and honey bees.

Ideas for Beltane:

* Start a new project, or put energy into an existing one
* Decorate with flowers
* Go for a neighborhood walk and look for blossoms
* Have a bonfire
* Make a cheese plate
* Drink some floral tea—maybe a nice lavender with lemon?
