Winter is a period of dormancy, a time to restore your energy after a full and busy year. Take this opportunity to slow down, relax a little, and take comfort.

## Imbolc

Imbolc is the mid-point between the winter solstice and spring equinox, and observes the increasing daylight as spring is on its way. This is a great moment to think about what to achieve in the year ahead.
